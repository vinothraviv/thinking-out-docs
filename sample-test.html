<h3> Rules </h3>

  <li> Reward players ability to predict match results over an entire tournament
     <ul> 
          <li> Correct Result Prediction: +3 </li>
          <li> In-Correct Result Prediction: -1 </li>
          <li> Correct Result Prediction: +2, when match full match is not played. e.g. rain-shortened, super-over-extened  </li>
          <li> In-Correct Result Prediction: 0, when match full match is not played. e.g. rain-shortened, super-over-extened  </li>
     </ul>  
   </li>
</ol>

<ol> 
  <li> Reward players ability to make risky predictions
     <ul> 
          <li> Bonus For Correct Prediction Against the Entire Board: +3, e.g. one player wins everyone else looses </li>
          <li> Bonus For Correct Prediction Against the Majority Of the Board: +2 e.g. upto two or three players win everyone else looses </li>          
     </ul>  
   </li>
</ol>

<ol> 
  <li> Discourage, gaming the system by skipping games
     <ul> 
          <li> First 2 Skip games results in 0 points.  </li>
          <li> Subsequent 2 Skip games results in: -5 points.  </li>
          <li> Idea is to enable skip games for genuine reasons e.g. the game is truly 50:50 and doesn't really test skill to pick one.. or missed due to any reason</li>
          <li> Also idea is to bump up accountability and risk when player uses skip, there is a liability, can't do it forever. </li>
          <li> Allow players to pick default predictions for entire tournament. </li>
     </ul>  
   </li>
</ol>

  <li> Discourage, gaming the system by playing the board instead of playing the game
     <ul> 
       <li> the predictions of players is kept hidden until match begins </li>
       <li> the predictions of the each player can be made public upon each players choice - just to add some spice </li>
     </ul>  
   </li>
</ol>

<ol> 
  <li> Avoid gameplay restrictions due to multiple time-zones
     <ul> 
       <li> give if-then-that options </li>
       <li>e.g. if team-A bats first, then I pick team-A, else team-B</li>
       <li>e.g. if team-A wins toss, then I pick team-A, else team-B</li>
       <li>e.g. if player-1 in team-A is in playing-11, then I pick team-A, else team-B</li>
       <li>freeze the prediction pick just before the 1st ball of the game, not before toss</li>
     </ul>  
   </li>
</ol>
